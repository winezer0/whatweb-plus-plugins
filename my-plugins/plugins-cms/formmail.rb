description "
FormMail is a Perl script written by Matt Wright to send mail with sendmail from the cgi-gateway. Early version didn't have a referer check. New versions could be misconfigured. Spammers are known to hunt them down (by means of cgi-scanning) and abuse them for their own evil purposes if the admin forgot to check the settings.http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/3954/discussion/"
