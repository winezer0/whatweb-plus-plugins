description "The Major BBS (sometimes MajorBBS or MBBS) was a bulletin board system server developed between 1986 and 1999 by Galacticomm. In 1995 it was renamed Worldgroup Server and bundled with a user client interface program named Worldgroup Manager for Microsoft Windows. Originally DOS based, two of the versions were also available as Unix-based edition, and the last versions were also available for Windows NT-based servers. - More Info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Major_BBS"
